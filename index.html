                <h2>Objects</h2>
                <p>
                JavaScript objects are containers for named values, called properties or methods. Think about a computer.
                a computer is an object, a computer has properties such as what graphics card, motherboard and procesor
                 you are using. An object stores all of that informtaion in a variable name to be called when you need it. 
                 Check out the example below:
            <pre><code><div class="samplecode">
let PCsetup = {             //you can see in this example that the main object is PC setup, 
    pc: {                   //in real world terms,everything that compiled together makes your gaming setup.
        case: {             //objects can also contain other objects!
            graphics:'',    //this line shows that a PC is not just a plastic box,
            motherboard:'', //but it contains smaller parts that can be called.
            processor:'',
            cooling:'',
            power:'',
            hard-drive:'',
            ram:'',
        }
    }
    essentials:{
        keyboard:'',
        mouse:'',
        monitor1:'',
    }
    accessories:{
        headset:'',
        external-speakers:'',
        mouse-pad:'',
        desk:'',
        chair:'',
    }
    streaming-supplies:{
        mic:'',
        webcam:'',
        stream-deck:'',
    }
}                   
            </div></code></pre></p></div></section>
<section id="arrays" name="arrays">
    <div class="textright">   <h2>Arrays</h2>
        <p>
            Arrays are similar to objects in that they are used to store information. 
            The most prominent use of arrays is as lists. Take for example a list of your favorite games.
            To list them all as seperate variables would look like this:
        <pre><code><div class="samplecode">
let game1 = "Skyrim";
let game2 = "Red Dead Redemption";
let game3 = "Mass Effect Trilogy";           
        </div></code></pre>
        That is a lot of code and can become confused the more items their are!
        Using an Array we can tie all these games to one variable and then call upon specific games
        dependant on their index location. Check out this Array below:
        <pre><code><div class="samplecode">
//index values:   0                 1                     2                     3
let favegames = ["Skyrim", "Red Dead Redemption", "Mass Effect Trilogy", "Bioshock Series", 
                            
//       4                 5                 6
"League of Legends", "No Man's Sky", "Any TellTale Game"]   // rip telltale games :,(            
        </div></code></pre>
        As you can see we were able to list DOUBLE the amount of games, with one less line of code, all under ONE variable.
        It is important to note the index values of each game, the list starts at 0 progresses forward, you will need this when 
        you want to call a specific game or games instead of the entire list. Also note that we determine that the list is an array
        by the use of square brackets "[  ]" instead of curly brackets "{  }".
    </p> 
</div>
</section>


<section id="forLoops" name="forLoops">
    <div class="textright">
        <h2>forLoops</h2>
<p>
    Loops execute a block of code a number of times. They are helpful when you want to run the same code repeatedly with a different value each time.
    The code below is how a forLoop is formally setup.
    <pre><code><div class="samplecode">
        for(statement 1; statement 2; statement 3;){
            code block to be executed
        }  
    </div></code></pre>
    What the above code is saying is "Statement 1" is executed one time before the code block. "Statement 2" defines the condition for 
    running the code block. "Statement 3" is excuted after the code block every time until the condition is met. The following code will 
    count from 0 to 100 by 1's and stop at 100.
    <pre><code><div class ="samplecode">
for( x = 0; x <= 100; x ++){
    console.log(x);
}

    </div></code></pre>
